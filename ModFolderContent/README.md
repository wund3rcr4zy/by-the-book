# Wund3rcr4zy's ByTheBook

Adds a new SyncDisk "Private Eye License" to the Weapons Locker purchase options.
This disk provides the following features:

### Main Effect
#### Option1: 'Detective Consultant' 
* On Install: The Enforcer guard on duty at a crime scene can be asked for a guest pass.
  * Higher social credit affects the odds of success up to a 75% success rate.
  * The "guard" is usually found standing against a wall after crime scene tape has been put up.
* On Upgrade 1: Walking into a crime scene will always grant a guest pass if required.

# Manual Installation

* Ensure you have BepInEx BE installed
* Extract the mod to ".\BepInEx\plugins\", so you should have ".\BepInEx\plugins\ByTheBook\ByTheBook.dll"
